    <h3><b>Methods:</b></h3>
    <p>
      A method is a block of code that does a specific task. Up until now we’ve been writing all our code in the main method. We will now learn how to write methods separate from main.
<br/><br/>
 To make a method in Java, you must follow the template below:<br/><br/>
 public static returnType methodName(parameters) // header<br/>
 <br/>
   // code goes in here<br/>
 <br/><br/>

 The important thing to understand write now is the header. Every method starts with the keywords “public static”. What these keywords mean exactly is beyond the scope of our lessons, so for now just know that they are necessary.
<br/><br/>
 The return type following these keywords indicates what data type the method will be returning. We will get into this more later on in this lesson.
<br/><br/>
 Next is the method name. Just like variable names, method names can be anything you choose, and are simply the identifiers we use to refer to a particular method.
<br/><br/>
 We will get into parameters later on in this lessons.
<br/><br/>
 Let’s make a simple method that prints out “Hello World”.

<br/>

    <p>
      Notice that the return type of our print method is “void”. This indicates that the method will not be returning anything. This makes sense because all its doing is printing out two words.
Once you make a method, it will not be executed until you call it. When you run a Java program, it starts running in main. From main you can transfer control to other methods, executing them. In this case, we are calling the print method in line 5. The way to call a method is the following:
<br/><br/>
methodName(parameters);
<br/><br/>
You simply write the name of the methods, followed by any parameters you are sending to it enclosed in parenthesis. In this case, the print method does not take any parameters, so the parentheses are empty. Again, no need to worry too much about parenthesis right now, we will get more into them later.
<br/><br/>
Once the program hits the method call in line 5, control immediately jumps to the print method, and the code inside of it executes. In this case, the code is simply printing out the words “Hello World”. Once the the method finishes executing, control jumps back to main, continuing onto line 6.
<br/><br/>
You can repeatedly call method as many times as you want, and it will always execute from the beginning.

<p>
 This method is pretty boring as it only prints out “Hello World”. To mix things up a little, lets change it up so it prints any string that we send to it as a parameter.
<br/><br/>
 A we can send variables to methods, and then that method can use those variables however it wants. So for example, we can send a string variable to the print method, and the print method can then output that string to the screen.
<br/><br/>
 To have a method take parameters, we add the data type followed by the variable name in the header of the method between the parenthesis. We can then send a variable of the same type to that method when calling it.

<br/>

<p>
 Notice the parameter name in the method call can be different from the parameter name in the header of the method being called. What’s important is the data type, they must match. In other words, you cannot have a method take an int, but send it a string when calling.
<br/><br/>
 Let’s make things just a little bit more complex. We will make a method called ‘add’ that will take two ints as parameters, and output their sum. To have a method take two parameters, we simply list them out (data type followed by name), separated by comma.

<br/>


<hr>
<br/>
  <center><img src="image4.jpg"  alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:500px;height:430px;">

<br/><br/>
<hr>

<p>
 Notice how the two parameters for the add function are separated by comma. When we call this method, we must send in exactly two integers as that is what it is expecting. This method again is void because we are not returning anything, simply printing the sum of ‘a’ and ‘b’ to the console.
<br/><br/>
 Now let’s talk about return types. What if we didn’t want to print the sum in ‘add’ but rather in main? To achieve this, we can return the sum of ‘a’ and ‘b’ back to main using the “return” keyword, and then main can print it. The return type of ‘add’ will not longer be void then, it will be int, as we will be returning an integer back to main. The sum of two integers is still an integer.
<br/><br/>
 Two retrieve the sum back in main, we have to assign it to a variable. We do this by simply assigning the method call to a sum variable. This may seem confusing at first, but all its doing is taking the result of that method call (the return value i.e. the sum) and assigning it to a varriable. Essentially, we are “catching” the return in a variable in main.
<br/>

<p>
 Notice the changes we made to the “add” method. We packed the sum in a variable called ‘sum’, and then used the “return” keyword to return it. The return type is int, because what we are returning is of type int.
<br/><br/>
Back in main, we are catching the return in an int variable. Once we have the return stored in a variable, we can simply print it out. Here we are calling “add” three times, each time with different parameters, and catching the return of each of these in three different variables which are outputted later.
<br/><br/>
Here is an example of a method that takes multiple parameters and returns a string.

<p>
 We can even pass an array to a method. So let us now make a method called “printArray” that simple prints an array.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<p>
 Take an array as a parameter, you need the data type as always, but it must be followed by the square brackets to indicate that this parameter is an array. After this, you can name the parameter. To pass an array to a method, you simply write the name of the array, no square brackets needed here.
<br/><br/>
As you can see, this method is void, because all it does it print info to the screen. It does not return any info back to back.
<br/><br/>
To finish off, let’s make a method that take an array, and return the largest number in the array. We can then print this number in main.
<br/><br/>
To find the maximum in an array is simple: we start off by assuming the 0th element is the maximum. We then loop through the array starting at element 1, and with every element we ask “is it bigger than the max we have so far?”. If it is, we make it the new max. If not, we simply move on. By the time we exit the loop, we will have the maximum element in the array.

<br/><br/>

<p>
 Notice here the return type of the “getMax” method is int. This is because we are returning the maximum value in an int array, which of course must be an int. We then catch that return in main and print it out.
