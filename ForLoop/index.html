    <h3><b>For loop:</b></h3>
 <p>
   Most programs involve doing something over and over again. To make things
    easier, the Java language has loops which can be used to repeat certain
    lines of code. In this lesson, we will learn about one particular type
     of loop, called the for-loop.
<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted to print out “Hello world"
<br/>
<br/>
Let’s say you wanted to print out onto the screen”Hello World” 10 times.
How would you go about doing this? Well, for someone who doesn’t know about
loops, they may simply type out 10 print statements. This will work, yes,
but it is definitely the wrong way to go about it. The problem with this is
that it will get very tedious when scaled up. What if you had to print
something out 100, or even 1,000,000 times? Im sure no one wants to sit
in front of a computer for hours typing out one million print statements.
The correct way to do this is using a for-loop.
<br/>
<br/>
For-loops have a very specific structure: the header and the body.
The body is where you write all the lines of code that you wish to be
looped. The header, one the other hand, is divided into three sections.
A rough outline of what a for-loop should look like is below:
<br/>
        </p>
         <br/>


    <hr>
    <br/>
      <center><img src="IMG_5715.jpg"  alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:550px;height:300px;">
 </center>
    <br/>
    <hr>


    <p>
      It’s almost never a good idea to let a loop go on forever, so you will need to tell it:
      <br/>
    </p>
    <ol>
<li>Where to start</li>
<li>Where to end</li>
<li>How to progress (increment)</li>
</ol>

<p>
This is where the header comes in. The first section of the loop will be
used to initialize an int variable that will tell us at which number the
loop begins. The middle section holds a condition, which as long as it’s
true, the loop will continue, and when it is false the loop will terminate.
The final section tells us how the int variable will change or progress.
</p>


           <hr>
           <br/>
             <center><img src="IMG_5716.jpg"  alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:450px;height:350px;">
        </center>
           <br/>
           <hr>


    <p>
      Now here is a for-loop in action. We start with an int variable ‘i’
      initialized to 1. The middle section says, “as long as the the
      variable ‘i’ is less than or equal to 5, go inside the body and execute
       any code in there”. The third section will add 1 to ‘i’ after
       executing the code in the body. So the order looks something like
       this:
       <br/>
       <br/>
    </p>

    <ul>
<li>‘i’ = 1</li>
<li>Is i <= 5? Yes it is, so go into the body and print “Hello World”</li>
<li>Increment i, i = 2</li>
<li>Is i <= 5? Yes it is, so go into the body and print “Hello World”</li>
<li>Increment i, i = 3</li>
<li>Is i <= 5? Yes it is, so go into the body and print “Hello World”</li>
<li>Increment i, i = 4 </li>
<li>Is i <= 5? Yes it is, so go into the body and print “Hello World”</li>
<li>Increment i, i = 5</li>
<li>Is i <= 5? Yes it is, so go into the body and print “Hello World” </li>
<li>Increment i, i = 6 </li>
<li>Is i <= 5? No it is not. Exit loop and move on to any code after it.</li>

</ul>
<p>
<br/>
The result is “Hello World” prints out 5 times. The beauty of this is that
we can just as easily print it a 100 times by simply changing the condition
in the for-loop to: i <= 100
<br/>
<br/>

We can even use the int variable in the header itself within the body of the
loop. If we wanted to print the numbers 1 to 10, for example,  we would
simply write this:
</p>

<hr>
<br/>
<center><img src="IMG_5717.jpg"  alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:650px;height:270px;">
</center>
<br/>
<hr>

<p>
If we wanted to print only the even numbers we could start our loop at 2
instead of one, and keep adding 2 to ‘i’, like so:
</p>

<hr>
<br/>
<center><img src="image0.jpg"  alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:650px;height:280px;">
</center>
<br/>
<hr>

<p>
You can, of course, do more than just print stuff in the body of the loop.
The body can contain any number of lines of code, however complex. As an
example, let’s try to add up all the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
The way to go about doing this by first setting up a variable that we can use
to keep a running total. Then with each iteration of the loop, we can add the
next number to that variable, until we’ve added all the numbers up to 10. </p>

<p>
We start ‘sum’ at 0, and use the loop to keep adding ‘i’ (which starts at
1, and with each iteration increments until it gets to 10) to it in the body
 of the loop. The variable ‘sum’ will continuously be updated with each
 iteration. Once the loop terminates, we can print the sum using a simple
 print statement outside the loop.
<br/><br/>
Hint: You can see how the variable ‘sum’ updates with each iteration by
printing it within the body of the loop.
