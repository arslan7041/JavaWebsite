    <h3><b>Arrays:</b></h3>
 <p>
   Sometimes having just one or two variables won’t do, you’ll need an
   entire group of them, maybe dozens, maybe even hundreds. This is where
    arrays come in. Arrays are a simple data structure in Java that allows
     you to store a collection of variables (or elements) of the same data
     type, in sequential order. So if you need 10 integers, instead of
     declaring 10 different integers, you can simply declare an array
     of size 10 that holds integers.
<br/><br/>
The syntax for declaring an array is as follows:<br/>
dataType[] nameOfArray = new dataType[sizeOfArray]
<br/><br/>
So for example, if we wanted to declare an array to hold 10 ints, we would say:
<br/>
int [] numbers = new int[10];
<br/><br/>
We would now have an array called ‘numbers’ which can hold up to 10 ints.
You can access these ints by indexing the array. Array’s use zero-based
indexing, so since this array is of size 10, the indices go from 0 to 9.
A simple way of thinking about is that its like a line of 10 boxes.
The boxes are numbered 0-9 and each box has an item inside of it.
In this case, the ‘item’ happens to be an int as that is the datatype
 of our array.
<br/><br/>
The way to access an array element using its index is by typing out
its name, followed by the index (box number) you want.

    <p>
      Since Java fills in int array with 0’s by default,
       the code above will print a list of zeros. You can
       change the value of each element by accessing it, and assigning to it.

    <p>
      Now, there is a faster way to fill in all the values in an array.
       You can use something called an initializer list when creating an
       array. In this list, you can simply type out all the values
       you want for the corresponding element and that is how your
       array will be created.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice the size of this array is 5, but didn’t explicitly have to
      write that anywhere this time. This is because when you use an
      initializer list to create an array, the size of the array will
      automatically be the size of your list. Since we listed out 5
      elements, the array will be of size 5.
<br/> <br/>
Now if we created an array of size 10 like this, wouldn’t it get tedious
to print out all 10 elements like we did above one by one? Luckily, we
can use a for loop to solve that problem. We can simply have a for loop
that starts at 0, and increments one by one all the way to less than the
size of the array. The loop counter will act as the index of the array
and we can use it to access each element.
<br/>

    <hr>

    <p>
      Notice here that the loop goes up to < 10 and NOT <= 10. Remember
       that there is no 10th index, the last index of an array of size
       10 is 9. As a general rule, remember that the last index of an
       array of size ‘SIZE’ is always ‘SIZE-1’.
        <br/> <br/>

Typically, however, you should never hard-code the size when looping through
an array. If we had 15 different loops going through the ‘numbers’ array, and
we suddenly decided to modify my array by adding or deleting a number, that’s
15 different loops we’d have to modify. To get around this, we should use
the length property of an array. The length property automatically gives
us the length of the array, so we don’t have to figure it out ourselves.
Its demonstrated below with a string array:

    <p>
      No need to count the number of colors listed, simple use colors.length
       as above and this will give you the exact length of the array,
       whatever that happens to be. Now if we happened to go back to our
       code and take the last 3 colors out of our array, the for-loop will
        still work as the correct length will be evaluated by colors.length.
<br/><br/>
If we wanted to make an array of size 100, using an initializer-list would take
a very long time. A much easier way would be to declare an array of size 100
(filled with zeros by default), and then overwrite those zero’s with the
values you want using a for-loop.
<br/><br/>
In the code below, we will fill up an array with all the numbers from 1 to 100,
and then add up all the values of the array in a variable called ‘sum’.
